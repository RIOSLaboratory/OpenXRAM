# OpenXRAM
OpenXRAM is an open-source SRAM(/RRAM/MRAM).. compiler developed by RIOS Lab.
Which could generate high performance SRAM IP with open-source techinology.
We are bulid the architecture of this compiler.

This project has 6 developing stages. And we would present all SRAM tech to the open-source comunity.
